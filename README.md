# trio_genetic_map
## The purpose of this project is to denovo construct a consensus genetic map, by leveraging a high quality genome and Trio mapping;
### There are three main elements needed in order to build a trio-based consensus map
 * 1. Markers information: markers were mapped to a target high quality reference genome to locate their positions and orders
 * 2. Pedigree information: a list of trios (progeny and parents)
 * 3. Genotype information: To indicate marker genotypes
