# trio_genetic_map
## Description
The purpose of this project is to _denovo_ construct a consensus genetic map, by leveraging a high quality genome and Trio mappinp
## Summary
    ### There are three main elements needed in order to build a trio-based consensus map
      1. Marker information: marker squences were mapped to a target high quality reference genome to locate their positions and orders
      2. Pedigree information: a list of trios (progeny and parents)
      3. Genotype information
